# pycture

Have you ever wanted to embed the code in this repository in an image? Of course
you do! That's why I hereby present `pycture`!

## How to use

Run this folder on an image:

```bash
python3 . test.jpg
```

Then image will then be converted and used to spread the joy to other images!

```bash
python3 test.jpg test.png
```

The images themselves can still be viewed as normal!

## How to reverse

Why would you want to do that?

You don't like it? No, it's just that you don't know that you already loved it!
